# Bibliothek - A Cutting-Edge Approach to Read Books!
Bibliothek is an application developed to manage a library system. This application aims to manage books, reservations, and loan processes. It also provides reports on popular books, allowing users to access the most borrowed books.

## Features
Bibliothek offers a comprehensive set of features designed to streamline the management of a library system:

- Effortless Book Management: Easily add, edit, and delete books in your library. Keep your catalog up to date with minimal effort.
- Seamless Reservation Handling: Manage book reservations with ease, ensuring that your users have access to the books they need, when they need them.
- Efficient Loan Processing: Simplify the loan process by keeping track of borrowed books and ensuring timely returns.
- Insightful Reporting: Generate detailed reports on the most popular books, helping you understand the reading trends and preferences in your library.
- This application is designed to be a powerful tool for libraries of all sizes, ensuring smooth operations and providing valuable insights into book usage and demand. Although a user interface is not currently implemented, the robust backend can be integrated with any UI framework or used directly via API endpoints.
